# pcostr
Python Code and Other Stuff TutoRial - my first Python program. An ambitious collab w CGPT to build a chat application using Python, Flask and (ultimately) nostr.

## I want to learn (1) how to build a nostr client and (2) how to use Python

Lofty goals for an overly employed greybeard who gets distracted always, but GOALS.
